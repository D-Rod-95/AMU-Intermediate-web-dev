            <h2>Zero-Based Budgeting</h2>
            <p>Zero-based budgeting requires you to allocate every dollar of your income to specific expenses, savings, or investments, ensuring that your income minus your expenses equals zero.</p>

            <h2>Envelope Budgeting</h2>
            <p>Envelope budgeting involves dividing your income into different categories and placing the allocated amount into envelopes. Once the money in an envelope is spent, you cannot spend any more in that category until the next budgeting period.</p>
